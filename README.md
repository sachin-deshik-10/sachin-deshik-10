## 🌟 Who Am I?

Hi, I’m **Sachin Deshik** — Electronics & Communication Engineer by degree, technology explorer by passion, and creative problem solver by default. I love standing at the crossroads of code, creativity, security, and design.

- 🤖 **AI Lover:** Building smart systems that surprise me (and sometimes, scare me a little).
- 🔐 **Security Buff:** Because “It works!” isn’t enough—it must be secure!
- 🎨 **Design Thinker:** “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — Leonardo da Vinci

Let’s make tech that’s bold, beautiful, and unbreakable.

## 🚀 Experience & Projects

Where wild ideas crash into reality!

### 1. **Real-Time GPS MQTT Integration**
*“Not all those who wander are lost.” — J.R.R. Tolkien*  
Built a GPS data streamer using MQTT—think of it as real-time location magic with encryption and minimal lag. Perfect for tracking anything that moves (or tries to run away).

### 2. **YOLO for Airborne Object Detection**
*“The sky’s the limit!”*  
Designed a drone/object tracker using YOLO & TensorFlow to spot flying objects in busy airspaces. Like having an eagle-eyed AI on your team.

### 3. **5G ORAN AI Optimizer**
*“Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.” — Peter Drucker*  
Created an AI pipeline to turbocharge spectrum allocation for 5G networks. Making telcos smarter, one algorithm at a time.

### 4. **Sensor Libraries – IRST & RADAR**
*“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” — Aristotle*  
Wrote Python libraries for signal acquisition, object tracking, and threat modeling—battle-tested in tough simulations.

### 5. **Full Stack Dashboards for AI Data**
*“Data is the new oil.” — Clive Humby*  
Built interactive dashboards that blend JS and Python for real-time AI analytics. If you like your data beautiful and actionable, you’ll love these.
